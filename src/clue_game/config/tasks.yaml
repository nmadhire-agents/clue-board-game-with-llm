# Player task to take their turn
player_turn_task:
  description: >
    It's your turn in the Clue game! You are {player_name}.
    
    Your objective is to solve the mystery by figuring out:
    - WHO committed the murder (which suspect)
    - WHAT weapon was used
    - WHERE it happened (which room)
    
    On your turn, you should:
    1. First, check your cards to know what's definitely NOT the solution
    2. Review your knowledge from previous suggestions
    3. Check your current location and available moves
    4. Move to a room you want to investigate
    5. Make a suggestion about the suspect and weapon (the room is your current room)
    6. Analyze the response - if someone disproves it, that card is NOT the solution
    7. If you're confident you know the solution, you may make an accusation
    
    STRATEGY TIPS:
    - Cards in YOUR hand are definitely NOT the solution
    - Cards shown to you by others are NOT the solution
    - If NO ONE can disprove a suggestion, those items are likely the solution
    - Only make an accusation when you're very confident - wrong accusations eliminate you!
    
    Take your turn now. Think step by step about what you know and what to do.
